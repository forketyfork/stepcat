# Example Implementation Plan

This is an example implementation plan file for Stepcat. Replace this with your actual implementation plan.

Steps will be automatically marked with [done] as they are completed.

## Step 1: Project Setup

Set up the basic project structure:
- Initialize npm project
- Install dependencies
- Configure TypeScript
- Set up linting and testing

## Step 2: Implement Core Feature

Implement the main feature:
- Create necessary modules
- Add business logic
- Integrate with external services if needed

## Step 3: Add Tests

Add comprehensive test coverage:
- Write unit tests
- Write integration tests
- Ensure all tests pass

## Step 4: Documentation

Add documentation:
- Update README with usage instructions
- Add code comments
- Create API documentation if applicable

## Step 5: Final Touches

Polish the implementation:
- Run linting and fix any issues
- Optimize performance
- Review and refactor code

Note: Stepcat will automatically mark steps as done by appending [done] to the step heading.
